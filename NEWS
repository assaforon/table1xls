Version 0.3.1 Release Notes (early summer 2014) 
==============================

Bug fixes:

- Added automatic file-saving to `XLgeneric` (as promised by help text)
- `row1,col1` are now "as advertised", i.e. the export really begins at the cell you tell it to (in some functions it was only "approximate").

New features:

- Added `XLaddText` for putting a text string anywhere in the file. This function is now the behind-the-scenes method for adding titles to tables in all other export functions.
- `XLregresSummary` now also accepts a matrix as input, instead of providing effect names, point estimates and SEs separately (which is still possible). 


Version 0.3 Release Notes (spring 2014, targeting R 3.1.0) 
==============================

- Added `XLgeneric` for exporting a generic rectangular dataset
- Fixed bug on handling missing values in XLoneWay, XLtwoWay, and explicitly added 'useNA' option passed directly on to table().
- Added option not to write a percents table in XLtwoWay.
- Fixed bug in XLoneWay that returned counts as text when `combine=FALSE`.
- Added an `XLConnect::saveWorkbook` command to all export functions, so that all changes are immediately saved to file.
- Added this NEWS file...


Version 0.2 (October 2013): first release
